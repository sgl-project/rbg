# Failure Handling

RBG supports multiple failure handling policies: `None` and `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart`.

![failure-handling](../img/failure-handling.png)

## Restart Policy Types

| Policy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `None` | No automatic restart action; rely on default pod restart behavior. Failed pods are replaced through normal reconciliation. |
| `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart` | Recreate only the affected role instance when a pod fails or a container restarts. Default for `leaderWorkerPattern` and `customComponentsPattern`. |

## Configuration

Set the `restartPolicy` field on the pattern (`leaderWorkerPattern` or `customComponentsPattern`).
`standalonePattern` has no `restartPolicy` field — it is always `None` (single pod, recreating the instance is equivalent to normal pod replacement).

`restartPolicy` is an object with the following fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `type` | string | `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart` | Restart policy type: `None` or `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart`. |
| `baseDelaySeconds` | int | `30` | Base delay (seconds) for exponential backoff between restart attempts. Set to `0` with `maxDelaySeconds: 0` to disable backoff entirely. |
| `maxDelaySeconds` | int | `600` | Cap (seconds) for the exponential backoff delay. |

```yaml
apiVersion: workloads.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: RoleBasedGroup
metadata:
  name: restart-policy-demo
spec:
  roles:
    # Worker role with leaderWorkerPattern - recreate instance on pod failure (default)
    - name: worker
      replicas: 3
      leaderWorkerPattern:
        size: 2

          type: RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart
        template:
          spec:

    # StandalonePattern - no restartPolicy field (always None)

      replicas: 1
      standalonePattern:
        template:
          spec:
            containers:

                image: nginx:latest
```

## Exponential Backoff

When `restartPolicy.type` is `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart`, subsequent crash-triggered recreations within a stability window are delayed by exponential backoff:

- **First crash**: immediate recreation (no delay).
- **Second crash** (within the stability window): delayed by `baseDelaySeconds`.
- **Each subsequent crash**: delay doubles, capped at `maxDelaySeconds`.
- Formula: `delay = min(baseDelaySeconds * 2^(restartCount-1), maxDelaySeconds)`.

The stability window is `max(maxDelaySeconds * 2, 10 minutes)`. If the instance remains stable (no crashes) for longer than this window, `restartCount` resets to 0 and the next crash starts with immediate recreation again.

### Default Behavior Change

> **Note**: Before the backoff feature, pod crashes always triggered immediate recreation. With default settings (`baseDelaySeconds: 30`, `maxDelaySeconds: 600`), the second and
> subsequent crashes within the stability window now receive 30s→600s exponential delays. All existing workloads using the default `RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart` policy
> automatically inherit this behavior.

### Disabling Backoff

To disable backoff entirely and restore the pre-backoff behavior (immediate recreation on every crash), set both `baseDelaySeconds` and `maxDelaySeconds` to `0`:

```yaml
restartPolicy:
  type: RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart
  baseDelaySeconds: 0
  maxDelaySeconds: 0
```

### Custom Backoff Configuration

```yaml
restartPolicy:
  type: RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart
  baseDelaySeconds: 10
  maxDelaySeconds: 120
```

With the above configuration: first crash is immediate, second crash delayed 10s, third 20s, fourth 40s, fifth 80s, sixth and beyond capped at 120s.

> **Note**: `maxDelaySeconds` must be greater than or equal to `baseDelaySeconds` (enforced by CEL validation at admission). Because `maxDelaySeconds` defaults to 600, setting `baseDelaySeconds` above 600 without explicitly setting `maxDelaySeconds` will be rejected. If you need a base delay above 600s, set `maxDelaySeconds` to the same or higher value.

## Excluding Components from Restart Policy Trigger

You can prevent specific pods from triggering the role's restart policy by setting an annotation on the pod template. This is useful for auxiliary components (e.g., monitoring, logging sidecars) whose failures should not affect the main workload. The annotation works with any deployment pattern (standalonePattern, leaderWorkerPattern, or customComponentsPattern).

Set the annotation `rbg.workloads.x-k8s.io/restart-trigger-policy: "Ignore"` in the component's `template.metadata.annotations`:

```yaml
apiVersion: workloads.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: RoleBasedGroup
metadata:
  name: inference-demo
spec:
  roles:
    - name: engine
      replicas: 2
      customComponentsPattern:
        restartPolicy:
          type: RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart
        components:
          # Main inference component - will trigger restart policy on pod failure
          - name: inference
            size: 1
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: inference
                    image: inference:latest

          # Monitoring sidecar - will NOT trigger restart policy on pod failure
          - name: monitor
            size: 1
            template:
              metadata:
                annotations:
                  # This component's pod restart/delete will NOT trigger role/RBG recreation
                  rbg.workloads.x-k8s.io/restart-trigger-policy: "Ignore"
              spec:
                containers:
                  - name: monitor
                    image: monitoring:latest
```

When this annotation is set to "Ignore" on a component's pod template:
- Pod failure and container restart events from this component will NOT trigger the role's restart policy
- The restart policy (RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart) remains unaffected for other components
- Only pods from components WITHOUT this annotation (or with annotation set to "Inherit") will trigger the restart policy

## Use Cases

- **RecreateRoleInstanceOnPodRestart**: Worker roles where pod failure or container restart should recreate the affected instance.
- **None**: Monitoring/logging sidecars that don't affect the main workload. Failed pods are replaced individually.
- **restart-trigger-policy: "Ignore"** (annotation): Auxiliary components within a multi-component instance whose pod failures should not trigger the role's restart policy for the entire instance.
