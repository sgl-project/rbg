<!--
**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

Follow the guidelines of the [documentation style guide].
In particular, wrap lines to a reasonable length, to make it
easier for reviewers to cite specific portions, and to minimize diff churn on
updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md

To get started with this template:

- [ ] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

# KEP-NNNN: Your short, descriptive title

<!--
This is the title of your KEP. Keep it short, simple, and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the KEP is and should be considered as part of
any review.
-->

<!--
A table of contents is helpful for quickly jumping to sections of a KEP and for
highlighting any additional information provided beyond the standard KEP
template.

Ensure the TOC is wrapped with
  <code>&lt;!-- toc --&rt;&lt;!-- /toc --&rt;</code>
tags, and then generate with `hack/update-toc.sh`.

## Release Signoff Checklist

<!--
**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an
issue in [kubernetes/enhancements] referencing this KEP and targeting a release
milestone **before the [Enhancement Freeze](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/releases)
of the targeted release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core
Kubernetes—i.e., [kubernetes/kubernetes], we require the following Release
Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These
checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.
-->

Items marked with (R) are required *prior to targeting to a milestone / release*.

- [ ] (R) Enhancement issue in release milestone, which links to KEP dir in [kubernetes/enhancements] (not the initial KEP PR)
- [ ] (R) KEP approvers have approved the KEP status as `implementable`
- [ ] (R) Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] (R) Test plan is in place, giving consideration to SIG Architecture and SIG Testing input (including test refactors)
    - [ ] e2e Tests for all Beta API Operations (endpoints)
    - [ ] (R) Ensure GA e2e tests meet requirements for [Conformance Tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md)
    - [ ] (R) Minimum Two Week Window for GA e2e tests to prove flake free
- [ ] (R) Graduation criteria is in place
    - [ ] (R) [all GA Endpoints](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1806) must be hit by [Conformance Tests](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md) within one minor version of promotion to GA
- [ ] (R) Production readiness review completed
- [ ] (R) Production readiness review approved

## Summary



## Motivation

RBG currently creates one shared headless Service per role, and the Service selector includes all Pods of that role.

That behavior is acceptable when every Pod behind the Service is a real serving endpoint. But it would make requests for large EP inference engine
which only leader Pods are expected to accept requests abnormal

This problem occurs with runtimes such as `sglang`. In cross-nodes engine, follower Pods only run a dummy API server and
exposing those Pods by the role level Service makes requests routed to the dummy API servers.

The problem here is different from the per-replica headless Service problem. This KEP aim to keeping the role shared headless Service and controlling which Pods are targeted at.


- the shared Service name does not change, and the controller only needs to update Service selectors
- Pod `ServiceName` and `subdomain` do not change and direct Pod DNS identity does not change

This makes `LeaderOnly` a selector policy, not a service identity policy.


### Goals

1. Introduce a clear API for controlling which Pods are selected by the shared headless Service of a role.
2. Keep current behavior as the default and support a `LeaderOnly` mode for `RoleInstanceSet + leaderWorkerPattern`.
3. Ensure that switching between `Full` and `LeaderOnly` does not require Pod recreation or Service renaming.

### Non-Goals

1. Introducing per-replica headless Services or per-replica subdomain policy.
2. Changing Pod network identity, `ServiceName`, or `subdomain`.
3. Supporting patterns that do not define a leader component.


## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

#### Story 1

As an inference engineer using `sglang` in a multi-node pattern, I want the shared role Service to expose only leader Pods so that
followers that do not run a fully functional serving endpoint do not receive external traffic.

#### Story 2

As an operator building a gateway, I want one stable shared Service per role, but I only want the real serving Pods to appear in that Service's endpoints. 
This lets the gateway keep using Service-level discovery without routing requests to worker Pods that should only participate in internal execution.


#### Story 3
As a platform engineer, although we do supports pod level model gateway, e.g. `sgalng model gateway`, we still need a backup in case of gateway absent.
However, I can not control user behavior, and once they use `sglang` engine or `vllm` in headless mode to serve model across nodes, I need to
adopt service by manul and not automatic.

## Design Details

```go

type RoleSpec struct {
    // +optional
    NetworkConfig *NetworkConfig `json:"networkConfig,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkConfig struct {
    // TargetPolicy determines the policy that will be used when creating
    // the headless service, defaults to `Full`
    // +kubebuilder:validation:Enum={Full,LeaderOnly}
    TargetPolicy *TargetPolicy `json:"targetPolicy"`
}

type TargetPolicy string

const (
    // all pods would be routed to
    TargetFull TargetPolicy = "Full"
	
    // the headless service would only target at the leaders
    TargetLeaderOnly TargetPolicy = "LeaderOnly"
)
```

### Test Plan



[ ] I/we understand the owners of the involved components may require updates to
existing tests to make this code solid enough prior to committing the changes necessary
to implement this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite testing updates



##### Unit tests



##### Integration tests


##### e2e tests



### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

User can choose target policy of network. Once changed, the controller would update the service with corresponding target selector. 


###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.
